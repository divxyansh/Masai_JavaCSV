1. How will you tackle the challenge?
   I will first parse the input CSV and check if a cell contains a value or a formula. If it's a formula, I will compute it by referencing other cells, considering cell coordinates like A1, B2. I'll store the values in a 2D array to ensure referencing between cells is simple.

2. What type of errors would you check for?
   - Circular reference: A formula referencing itself or creating an infinite loop.
   - Out-of-bound errors: A formula referencing a cell that doesnâ€™t exist.
   - Invalid formulas: Non-numeric or incorrect syntax in the formula.
   - Empty or malformed input: Handling missing values or irregular CSV structures.

3. How might a user break your code?
   - By providing formulas that create a circular dependency (e.g., A1 = B1 + A1).
   - Entering non-numeric values in place of numbers in formulas.
   - Supplying an invalid CSV format or an empty file.
